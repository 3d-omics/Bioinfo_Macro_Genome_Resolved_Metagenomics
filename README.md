# Snakemake workflow: `mg_assembly`

A Snakemake workflow for Genome Resolved Metagenomics

## Features
- Preprocessing:
  - FASTQ processing with `fastp`.
  - Mapping of preprocessed reads against the host(s) and possible contaminants with `bowtie2`. Skip if no host is provided.
    - Useful for environmental genomics (there is no host in soil, duh!), or
    - environments that can have multiple genomes, like in mycorrhiza, where plant, fungus and even insects, can be there.
  - Assembly-free statistics with `kraken2`, `nonpareil` and `singlem`.
- Assembly of non-host reads with `megahit`.
  - Coassembly strategies denoted in the `samples.tsv` file. See below.
  - Taxonomic annotation of contigs with `kraken2`
  - Assembly quantification with `bowtie2` and `coverm`
- Bacterial metagenomics:
  - Binning with `CONCOCT`, `Maxbin2`, `MetaBAT2`, and aggregated with `MAGScoT`.
  - Annotation with `quast` (mag and contig lengths), `gtdbtk` (taxonomy), `dram` (functions) and `checkm2` (completeness and contamination)
  - Dereplication with `dRep`, using multiple secondary ANIs, in case you need one for read mapping (eg. 95%), and a different for something like pangenomics (98 and 99%).
  - Quantification with `bowtie2` and `coverm`. One per secondary ANI
- Viral metagenomics:
  - Identification and clustering with `genomad`, `bbmap` and `mmseqs`.
  - Quantification with `bowtie2` and `coverm`.
  - Annotation with `dram`, `virsorter2`, `checkv` and `quast`.
- Module reporting with `multiqc`, assisted with `samtools` and `fastqc`.



## Usage
1. Make sure you have `conda`, `mamba` and `snakemake` installed.
    ```bash
    conda --version
    snakemake --version
    mamba --version
    ```

2. Clone the git repository in your terminal and get in:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:3d-omics/mg_assembly.git
    cd mg_assembly
    ```

3. Test your installation by running the test data. It will download all the necesary software through conda / mamba. It should take less than 5 minutes.
    ```bash
    snakemake --use-conda --cores 8 test
    ```

4. Run it with your own data:

   1. Edit `config/samples.tsv` and add your samples names, a library identifier to differentiate them, where are they located, the adapters used, and the coassemblies each sample will belong to.

    ```tsv
    sample_id	library_id	forward_filename	reverse_filename	forward_adapter	reverse_adapter	assembly_ids
    sample1	lib1	resources/reads/sample1_1.fq.gz	resources/reads/sample1_2.fq.gz	AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA	AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT	sample, all
    sample2	lib1	resources/reads/sample2_1.fq.gz	resources/reads/sample2_2.fq.gz	AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA	AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT	all
    ```

    In the `assembly_ids` you can name all the coassemblies each library will belong to. If you don't want to use a sample (a blank or a failed sample), leave the field empty.


    2. Edit `config/features.yml` with reference databases:

    ```yaml
    hosts:  # Add more in case of multi-host, remove entries in case of environmental sample
      chicken: resources/reference/chicken_39_sub.fa.gz
      # pig: resources/reference/pig.fa.gz

    magscot:
      pfam_hmm: workflow/scripts/MAGScoT/hmm/gtdbtk_rel207_Pfam-A.hmm.gz
      tigr_hmm: workflow/scripts/MAGScoT/hmm/gtdbtk_rel207_tigrfam.hmm.gz

    databases:  # The pipeline does not provide or generate them. There are scripts tho.
      checkm2: resources/databases/checkm2/20210323/uniref100.KO.1.dmnd
      checkv: resources/databases/checkv/20230320/checkv-db-v1.5/
      dram: resources/databases/dram/20230811
      genomad: resources/databases/genomad/genomad_db_v1.7
      gtdbtk: resources/databases/gtdbtk/release214
      kraken2:  # add entries as necessary
        refseq500: resources/databases/kraken2/kraken2_RefSeqV205_Complete_500GB/20220505/
      singlem: resources/databases/singlem/S3.2.1.GTDB_r214.metapackage_20231006.smpkg.zb
      virsorter2: resources/databases/virsorter2/20200511/
    ```

    3. Edit `config/params.yml` with execution parameters. The defaults are reasonable.



5. Run the pipeline
     ```
     # make sure firsthand that you have all the databases above properly installed
     snakemake --use-conda --cores 8  # locally
     snakemake --use-conda --cores 24 --jobs 100 --executor slurm  # in slurm
     ```


6. Output:

    The main outputs are:
    1. `results/prokaryotes/annotate/`: MAG annotations.
    2. `results/prokaryotes/quantify/`: MAG and contig-wise quantifications.
    3. There is an experimental pipeline for viral identification with a similar structure. See below. The results are in `results/viruses/`.
    4. MultiQC html reports and tables next to the main modules: `preprocess`, `assemble`, `prokaryotes` and `viruses`.
